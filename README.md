# CS2-Projects

[CS2 Class Website](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/CS23001/)

Computer Science II is a class at Kent State University. The course is entirely focused on C++ programming, and involves advanced programming design with a primary focus on 
data structures and abstraction. The class is object-oriented in approach. 

The CS2-Projects repository focuses on projects completed during my CS2 coursework during my time at Kent State University. The projects in this repository demonstrate my journey in learning C++. 
As I progressed in learning C++ I learned valuable lessons about how to create a program. I began dealing with memory, and moved from a procedural to abstract programming style. 

C++ was my first programming language and CS2 was my first introduction to object-oriented problem solving.
